Autonomous Navigation with Raspberry Pi, ArUco Pose Estimation, and ESP32-IMU Integration

This GitHub repository showcases a comprehensive solution for autonomous navigation using a Raspberry Pi, ArUco pose estimation, and an ESP32 with an integrated IMU sensor. The project aims to create a reliable and robust autonomous navigation system for various applications, such as robotics, drones, and vehicles.

Key Features:

1. Raspberry Pi Control: The Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, responsible for high-level decision-making and interfacing with external sensors and actuators.

2. ArUco Pose Estimation: ArUco markers are used for precise and real-time pose estimation. The computer vision algorithms efficiently track these markers, providing accurate position and orientation information to guide the navigation process.

3. ESP32 with IMU: The ESP32 board is integrated with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor. The IMU data, including accelerations, gyroscopic rates, and magnetic field readings, is utilized as the primary navigation parameter calculator, enhancing the system's stability and response.

4. Error Correction: The ArUco pose estimation data and the IMU data are combined to enable sophisticated error correction mechanisms. This fusion of sensor data helps improve navigation accuracy, especially in challenging environments or situations with intermittent marker visibility.
